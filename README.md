## Random Servers Bot

!!This has been updated but i can't provide source for that beacuse i have implemented alot of db stuff that i would not want to make public.<br>
Also it would take alot of time on your part to set all of this up so yea u will have to do whit this simpler version.<br><br>

This is a discord bot that displays ips from https://mcscans.fi api and that is used in the Minescan discord server<br>
This will be updated to use my api instead someday. <br>
Code for the scanner can be found in this repo: https://github.com/cqlnx/mcprobe
